1) In two or three sentences discuss the advantages of using an array of structs versus parallel arrays when dealing with related data.  

An array of structs can store different data type of members, but parallel arrays only can store same data type of variables. 
Also, an array of structs is more organized than parallel arrays. It can define a group of members as a single object.

2) The preferred method of declaring a struct data type is in a header file. Briefly explain why. Hint: this is explained in the notes. 

After we declare a struct data type in a header file, we can use it by insert that header file’s code 
into our source code when we need it in any others file.

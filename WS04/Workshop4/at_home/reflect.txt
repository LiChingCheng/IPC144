1) In one or two sentences explain why the arrays in this program have to be declared to hold 10 elements? 
   We can enter the numbers of days from 3 to 10. In order to hold 10 elements, we need to declare the arrays to be 10.

2) In two or three sentences explain the advantages and disadvantages of using matching arrays? 
   It's convenient to keep several related data elements by using only one array to store all of them.
However, all of them need to be same types and we need to know how many elements that we are going to store.
If we set too many spaces but we didn’t use it, then it will waste of spaces. On the other hand, 
if we didn’t set enough spaces for it, then we won’t have enough spaces to keep all of the elements.

3) Was the at home portion of this workshop too easy, just right or too hard? Why? 
   I think on the bottom of the at home workshop is between just right and too hard.
Because the part of enter the day to see average temperature need to combine several logic.
We must know each logic well and know which instruction should be loop or not. 
Otherwise, we will be very confused.

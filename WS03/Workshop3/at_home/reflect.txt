1)Name all the iteration constructs.
  --While, do while, for.

2)In two or three sentences explain the difference between a “do while” and a “while” loop?
  --When we use do while , the code will execute the sequence at least one time no matter the 
condition is true or not. If the condition is true then it will do next condition, or if it is 
not true then it will stop. However, when we use while if the condition is true the sequence 
will execute but if the condition is not true the sequence won’t execute.

3)In two or three sentences explain what is meant by the term conditional expression?
  --Conditional expression ( condition ? operand : operand )is the same thing as if/else. 
When the condition is true it will execute the left operand. On the other hand, when the 
condition is not true, it will execute the right operand.

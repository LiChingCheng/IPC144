1- What do think is the most important thing you learned in this workshop? 
     After this workshop, we know how to use arithmetic in our code and how to chenge
type from using casting operation.
2- Why must you add .005 to the value derived when calculating the GST owing? 
     We want every amount’s gst can round it to the nearest hundredth. 
   Why is .005? The reason is that if an amount’s gst is 00.001, after we added .005 it became 00.006.
   Then, when we print(”%.2f”), it will show 00.01.   
3- What is the result of a casting operation? 
      All of balance owings supposed to print in integer. After we did casting operation, they can
    print out decimal point.
4- Why do you think you were required to use the modulus operator in this workshop?
      I think useing the modulus operator will make the code easier to read.
And also,through using modulus operator we know that we should let two operands 
in the same type,or it won't work.

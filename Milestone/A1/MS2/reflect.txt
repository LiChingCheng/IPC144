1. Can you think of a more efficient way to ask a user to add the required information to each data field? 
I think we can ask yes or no question in the beginning of each data field. In first case for example, 
if the user doesn’t have middle name, we can just print please enter the contact's first name and last name two line. 
So, in this case, we can use if/else if/else within the do while loop. Like below:

do{
	printf("Do you want to enter a middle initial(s)? (y or n): ");
	scanf("%s", &ans);
			
		if (ans == 'y' || ans == 'Y') {
			printf("Please enter the contact's first name: ");
			scanf("%30s", &fullName.firstName);
			printf("Please enter the contact's middle initial(s): ");
			scanf("%6s", &fullName.middleInitial);
			printf("Please enter the contact's last name: ");
			scanf("%35s", &fullName.lastName);                                                                                                                
i = 1;
		}
		else if (ans == 'n' || ans == 'N'){
			printf("Please enter the contact's first name: ");
			scanf("%30s", &fullName.firstName);
			printf("Please enter the contact's last name: ");
			scanf("%35s", &fullName.lastName);                                                                                                                
			i = 1;
		}
		else {
			i = 0;
		}

	} while (i == 0);

For me, if we use this way to ask, users can keep enter their name until the end and will not be interrupted by yes or no question in the middle.


2. Explain why a C string that is required to store up to 25 characters must be capable of storing 26 characters.
In C string, we need to add a terminator in the end of the word or sentence. It means we finish this line. 
We called it null terminator and we use ‘ \0 ’ to represent it in our code. 
That is why if we want to store up to 25 characters, we must to keep one more place for null terminator (‘ \0 ’).

1.	Briefly explain why you think this assignment has asked you to code a struct, Contact, that holds three other structs as data members. 
I think the reason that this assignment has asked us to code a struct, Contact, is because that is more organized.
We can collect three structs as a group (as one struct) and simply use this struct for each function not use separate struct for each function.

2.	What was the most difficult part of this assignment? 
I think to understand how to combine function and pointer is the most difficult thing.
Another thing is how to just pick the first character ‘y’ or ‘n’ when user enter ‘yes’ or ‘no’ in yes or no question 
because I still have not succeeded.

3.	How long did it take you to complete Milestone 4? 
Total around 6-7 hours.

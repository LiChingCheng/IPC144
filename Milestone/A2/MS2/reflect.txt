1.In 3 or 4 sentences explain the term “function” and briefly discuss the need for functions in any language?
Function is like a black box. It has some functions depends on what we put in it.
Different function need differ input and give differ output. 
We insert the input that the function wants and after this input working in the function, 
the function will give it result depends on what it returns or not. 

2.Briefly explain why you think the "helper" functions are in a different module and why those 
functions were not included in the "contacts" module?
When we create header files we hope themselves is cohesive but each header files should be low coupling 
that is the reason that we separate these two header files.
Contact file represents one function. It is for declare each struct type and then create related function prototype. 
If we didn’t declare in the beginning, we can’t create function prototype.
On the other hand, helper file is not related to contact file and each function are low coupling, 
so we put those separate functions together.

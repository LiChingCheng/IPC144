3. Briefly explain how the two functions findContactIndex and getTenDigitPhone benefit your source 
   code with respect to overall maintenance and readability.
 
 - findContactIndex and getTenDigitPhone functions help us to find the index of the cellphone number 
   that we entered and ensure we get the ten digits phone number. Both of them can be reused in other
   functions. When we want to fine the index or get ten digits phone number we just need to call 
   these two functions, it is very convenient for us and it also simplifies our code.

4. What did you learn most from doing Assignment 2? 

 - In the beginning, we didn’t create any function in contactHelper.h. For example, yes function. 
   So when we ask user to answer yes or no question, we have to repeat the code which is written in 
   the yes function again and again. After we create those functions, we can reuse functions and our 
   code become more easily to read. In addition, if one of functions is wrong, we can only change 
   that function not to change all the same codes in each place.
